Using test first development, write the program for the following prime number problem.

To run the tests, run the build with default settings.
To run the program, run the build with the run command/task.

Write a program that will ask the user to enter a number. The program will then print that many number of primes starting from 2.

Assume that the user enters a number greater than or equal to 1. Do not check for the possibility that the user enters anything other than a number greater than or equal to 1.

The interaction with the user should be like this, on the console. Do not create a GUI:
Please enter a number greater than or equal to 1: <user enters a number>
Here are <user entered number> primes starting from 2: 2, 3, 5, ...

Partial scores will be given for using functional style / iterators and not mutating any variables, that is, assignment is OK, but reassignment is not. When using functional style avoid using recursion.

Write the program so that if we decide to change the way the user will interact with the program then most of the code will not have to change.

Scores will be allotted for each part below:
Build setup properly [10]:
Program works as expected [10]:
Program deals with user input within stated expectations properly [10]:
Tests pass [10]:
Test Quality [10]:
Code coverage [10]:
Design quality [20]:
Code quality [10]:

Honoring immutability [10]: -10
        number_currently_being_tested += 1

Total [100]: 90
