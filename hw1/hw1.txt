Please keep all files related to a homework or an assignment within the appropriate directory. Files checked in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. Reasonable effort is expected from each person. If you do not check in, you will not receive any scores. When pairing please switch who checks in so there is significant number of check in from each of you.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat or to the mailing list. Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. If your last check in breaks the code, both you and your pair will lose significant points.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews. See the reviews/readme.txt file for details on how to ask for reviews.

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews. Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

You are still responsible to successfully complete an homework or assignment even if your pair is a no-show. You can request to change pairs at any time and if there is another person in the class willing to pair with you we can make the switch.

A lot of help will be provided in this course, but you have to start early and ask for help along the way.                                                                      

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.                   

The above details apply to all homework and assignments in this course.                   

Now to homework #1.
